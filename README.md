## How to setup for first time (localhost)?

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). [Start mongod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46523321/mongoerror-connect-econnrefused-127-0-0-127017) if there is problem with Db connection.

2. Open terminal and navigate to the server folder. Write `npm install` to install the dependencies 

3. Open terminal and navigate to the client folder. Write `npm install` to install the dependencies 

4. In the server folder run `npm start`. The frontend will run on port `3000`, and the backend will run on the port `8000`.
